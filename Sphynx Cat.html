    <body><h1>The fall of the Western Roman Empire</h1>
        <hr />
        Also called the fall of the <b>Roman Empire</b> or the fall of Rome, was the loss of central political control in the Western Roman Empire,
         a process in which the Empire failed to enforce its rule, and its vast territory was divided between several successor polities.
          The Roman Empire lost the strengths that had allowed it to exercise effective <b>control over its Western provinces</b>;
          modern historians posit factors including the effectiveness and numbers of the army,
           the health and numbers of the <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dQw4w9WgXcQ">Roman population</a>, the strength of the economy,
            the competence of the emperors, the internal struggles for power,
           the <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MdCcqRM5lnQ">religious</a>
            changes of the period, and the efficiency of the civil administration.</body>
